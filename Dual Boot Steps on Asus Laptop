# Dual **Boot** a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 on Windows 10 (64bit):
Following steps are what I did for my Dual Boot system Asus GT703G Laptop

Based on various blogs particularly this.[vip link to follow)

1) Downloaded Ubuntu i386 iso(for 32 bit) or amd64(for 64 bit) from here. 
Need to use amd64 Ubuntu iso file rather than i386 iso. It works for Intel machine(verified by ask-ubuntu).
2) Created bootable USB using this
3) Made the partition of 300 GB in my D drive to install Ubuntu
4) Disabled "fast boot" option
Shift+Restart-> Troubleshoot-> Advanced Setting->UIFE Firmware setting->Restart->Advanced mode->boot
5) Disable Secure Boot option
Shift+Restart-> Troubleshoot-> Advanced Setting->UIFE Firmware setting->Restart->Advanced mode->find somewhere here
6) Boot menu has 2 boot options. I have set higher priority to USB booting. As shown in the above screenshot.
7) Enabled USB Legacy Support
Shift+Restart-> Troubleshoot-> Advanced Setting->UIFE Firmware setting->Restart->Advanced mode->find somewhere here
8) Save and Restart

# A Short Note on Class-Imbalance Problem in OBject Detection

**What is class imbalance problem?**
In supervised learning based Object Detection require training dataset for each of the object calsses. Sometimes it may happen that you might not have enough or eqaul dataset for a particular class.
This leads to a problem called class imbalance problem while training the Object Detection Network. E.g. if you wanted to train a universal vehicle detector, you might find more images for cars and bikes but you might have very less images for carrier vehicles like mini-trucks etc,

**How does class imbalance problem effect?**
Performace on these less dataset would be very low. It is because network has not seen much images for such classes and will overlook features from such classes.

**Solution for class imbalance problem?**
Easiest solution is you sample the augmentation to avaoid class imbalance i.e. Oversample rare classes dataset and undersample frequent datasets. This might help in some cases.

Other solution is:
**The Focal Loss:**
Focal loss (FL) adopts another approach to reduce loss for well-trained class. So whenever the model is good at detecting background, it will reduce its loss and reemphasize the training on the object class.
This is achieved by extending the cross-entropy loss while penalizing the loss for lower weights.
